### Assignment_1: Protein-Protein-Interaction-Network-Analysis
Using the Human Protein-Protein Interactions dataset from the BioGRID database(https://downloads.thebiogrid.org/File/BioGRID/Release-Archive/BIOGRID-4.4.218/BIOGRID-ORGANISM-4.4.218.tab3.zip), perform a comprehensive network analysis. Compute the degree for each node and identify the top 10 hub nodes based on their degree. Analyze the degree distribution by plotting a graph to determine if the network follows a scale-free structure. Calculate the shortest path lengths for all node pairs and plot the distribution of these lengths. Additionally, compute betweenness and closeness centralities for each node and identify the top 10 nodes with the highest values for each centrality measure.
